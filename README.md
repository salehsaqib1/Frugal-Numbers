# Frugal-Numbers
Assignment 4

Prime Factorization:

A Prime Number is a whole number, greater than 1, that can only be divided
evenly by 1 or itself.
The Prime Factors of a given number are the prime numbers that divide it
evenly. Prime factorization is the process of finding the combination of
prime numbers that multiply to give a particular number. Every integer
greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization.
For example, the prime factorization of 225 is
225 = 32 x 52

Frugal Numbers:

Numbers can be classified based on their prime factorization. One
classification is as follows:

 Frugal Number:

A number that has more digits than the digits in its prime factorization
(including the number of digits in the powers)

Ex: 1024 = 210

1024 is frugal since it has 4 digits, whereas 210 has 3 digits (2
digits in the power).
However in the example above, 225 has 4 digits in its prime
factorization and therefore is not frugal.

 Equidigital Number:

A number that has digits equal to the digits in its prime factorization
(including powers)

Ex1: 7 = 7

Both sides have 1 digit
NOTE: when the power is 1 it is not written, therefore the
number of digits is only 1.

Ex2: 10 = 2x5

10 has 2 digits and so does ‘5x2’.

 Extravagant Number:

A number that has fewer digits than the digits in its prime factorization
(including powers)

Ex: 4 = 22

4 is a single digit number whereas 22 has two digits.
The number 225 that we looked at above is aldo extravagant.

Assignment

You are to write a program that reads a number ‘n’ and then generates and
outputs the first ‘n’ frugal numbers.

For example the frugal numbers up to 2000 are:
125, 128, 243, 256, 343, 512, 625, 729, 1024, 1029, 1215, 1250,
1280, 1331, 1369, 1458, 1536, 1681, 1701, 1715, 1792, 1849, 1875
Your program should use at least 1 function besides main(). Make sure to
run the program with values of n larger than 2000.
